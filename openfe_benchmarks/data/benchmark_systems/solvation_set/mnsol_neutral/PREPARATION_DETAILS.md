Systems extracted from the MNSol database (https://doi.org/10.13020/3eks-j059).

## Filtering

The reference data was generated using the [generate_mnsol_data.py](../../../data_generation/generate_mnsol_data.py) script. Entries were excluded if:

- The solute or solvent name was not present in `mnsol-name-to-smiles.json`
  - Molecules with ambiguous isomeric structure were expluded including: 'bromotoluene', 'chlorotoluene', 'dichloroethane', 'fluoroctane', 'trimethylbenzene'
- The solute is a radical (name contains "radical")
- The solute is a dimer (MNSol Level1=14)
- The net charge is non-zero

Conformer generation failed for: 6,7,8,9,10,10-hexachloro-1,5,5a,6,9,9a-hexahydro-6,9-methano-2,4,3-benzodioxathiepine-3-oxide(endosulfanalpha)

After filtering, **2449 systems** are retained.

Charges were generated using the [charge_freesolv.py](../../../data_generation/charge_freesolv.py) script using the [conda-lock_linux-64.yml](../../../data_generation/conda-lock_linux-64.yml) environment. 
Some ligands could not be charged with all methods, the following lists the ligands that could not be charged with each method:



## Notes

- Experimental uncertainties are set to 0.2 kcal/mol for all neutral entries, following the recommendation in the MNSol documentation.
- Solvent and solute SMILES are stored as canonical explicit-hydrogen SMILES generated by the OpenFF Toolkit.
