# Benchmark System Indexing by Calculation Type
#
# This file categorizes benchmark systems based on the inputs required for
# different OpenFE calculation types:
#
# - rbfe (Relative Binding Free Energy): Requires protein, ligands, and network
# - abfe (Absolute Binding Free Energy): Requires protein and ligands (no network)
# - rsfe (Relative Solvation Free Energy): Requires ligands and network (no protein)
# - asfe (Absolute Solvation Free Energy): Requires ligands only (no protein, no network)
#
# Note: All current benchmark systems include network files and have protein structures,
# making them suitable for RBFE calculations. Systems without proteins would be
# suitable for RSFE calculations.
